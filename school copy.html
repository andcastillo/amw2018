									<h3>Tutorial 1: Knowledge Collection and Knowledge Cleaning: Challenges, Models, and Applications</h3>
									<p>Xin Luna Dong, Amazon.</p>
									</header>
									<p>
									Large-scale knowledge repositories are becoming increasingly important as a foundation for enabling a wide variety 
									of complex applications. In turn, building high-quality knowledge repositories critically depends on the technologies 
									of knowledge collection and knowledge cleaning, which share many similar goals with data integration, while facing even 
									more challenges in extracting knowledge from both structured and unstructured data, across a large variety of domains, 
									and in multiple languages. Our tutorial highlights the similarities and differences between knowledge management 
									and data integration, and has two goals. First, we introduce the Database community to the techniques proposed 
									for the problems of entity linkage and relation extraction by the Knowledge Management, Natural Language Processing, 
									and Machine Learning communities. Second, we give a detailed survey of the work done by these communities in knowledge
									fusion, which is critical to discover and clean errors present in sources and the many mistakes made in the process of
									knowledge extraction from sources. Our tutorial is example driven and hopes to build bridges between the Database 
									community and other disciplines to advance research in this important area.<br>

									<h3>Tutorial 2: Communication Cost in Parallel Query Processing</h3>
									<p>Dan Suciu, University of Washington.</p>
									</header>
									<p>
									We consider the following problem: what is the amount of communication
									required to compute a query in parallel on p servers, over a large
									database instance?  We define the Massively Parallel Communication
									(MPC) model, where the computation proceeds in rounds consisting of
									local computations followed by a global reshuffling of the data.
									Servers have unlimited computational power and are allowed to exchange
									any data, the only cost parameters are the number of rounds and the
									maximum amount of communication per server.  Surprisingly, any
									multi-join query can be computed in a single communication round,
									however the price to pay is that the amount of data being reshuffled
									exceeds the input data.  I will describe tight bounds on the amount of
									communication for the case of single round algorithms on non-skewed
									data, and discuss some partial results for multiple rounds and for
									skewed data. Joint work with Paul Beame and Paris Koutris<br>

									<h3>Tutorial 3: Data, Responsibly</h3>
									<p>Julia Stoyanovich, Drexel University.</p>
									</header>
									<p>
									Big Data technology holds incredible promise of improving people's lives, 
									accelerating scientific discovery and innovation, and bringing about 
									positive societal change. Yet, if not used responsibly, this technology 
									can propel economic inequality, destabilize global markets and affirm 
									systemic bias. In this tutorial we will focus on the importance of using 
									Big Data technology responsibly – in a manner that adheres to the legal 
									requirements and ethical norms of our society.  
									We will define key properties, such as fairness, diversity, accountability, 
									and transparency.  We will give examples of concrete situations,
									 many of which were covered in recent popular press, where reasoning 
									 about and enforcing these properties is important.  
									 We will then discuss potential modeling and algorithmic approaches 
									 for quantifying and enforcing responsible practices, 
									 using real datasets and application scenarios from criminal sentencing, 
									 credit scoring, and homelessness services.<br>

									<h3>Tutorial 4: Large Scale Distributed Data Science from scratch using Apache Spark 2.1+</h3>
									<p>James G. Shanahan, Church and Duncan Group and University of California, Berkeley.</p>
									</header>
									<p>
									Apache Spark is an open-source cluster computing framework. It has emerged as the next
									generation big data processing engine, overtaking Hadoop MapReduce which helped ignite the big data
									revolution. Spark maintains MapReduce’s linear scalability and fault tolerance, but extends it in a few
									important ways: it is much faster (100 times faster for certain applications), much easier to program in due
									to its rich APIs in Python, Java, Scala, SQL and R (MapReduce has 2 core calls), and its core data
									abstraction, the distributed data frame. In addition, it goes far beyond batch applications to support a
									variety of compute-intensive tasks, including interactive queries, streaming, machine learning, and graph
									processing.
									This tutorial will provide an accessible introduction to large-scale distributed machine learning and data
									mining, and to Spark and its potential to revolutionize academic and commercial data science practices. It
									is divided into two parts: the first part will cover fundamental Spark concepts, including Spark Core,
									functional programming ala map-reduce, RDDs/data frames/datasets, the Spark Shell, Spark Streaming
									and online learning, Spark SQL, MLlib, and more; the second part will focus on hands-on algorithmic
									design and development with Spark (developing algorithms from scratch such as decision tree learning,
									association rule mining (aPriori), graph processing algorithms such as pagerank/shortest path, gradient
									descent algorithms such as support vectors machines and matrix factorization, and deep learning. The
									home homegrown implementations will help shed some light on the internals of the MLlib libraries (and on
									the difficulties of parallelizing some key machine learning algorithms). Industrial applications and
									deployments of Spark will also be presented. Example code will be made available in python (pySpark)
									notebooks.<br>
