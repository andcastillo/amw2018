									<h4>Speaker Bio</h4>
									<p>
									Dr Miriam Fernandez is a Research Fellow at the Knowledge Media Institute (KMi), Open University, and a senior member of the Social Semantics and Web Science group. Before joining KMi, she was research associate at Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain and software engineer (internship) at Google Zurich, Switzerland. Her research is at the intersection of the Web Science (WS) and Semantic Web communities (SW), where she has contributed with more than 100 peer-reviewed articles in various leading conferences and journals. She has extensive expertise in leading EU and national projects. She frequently participates in organising committees and editorial boards of the top SW and WS conferences, recently being program co-chair of the International Semantic Web conference in 2017, and serving as editor for the Journal of Web Semantics.

									<h4>Speaker Bio</h4>
									<p>
									Vanessa Murdock is a Principal Applied Researcher in Cortana Research at Microsoft.   Her research focuses on understanding user focus and attention online.  Previously (also at Microsoft) she led a research team to develop a machine learned ad platform, devise ML approaches to device fingerprinting, and leveraging social media to improve local search.  Prior to Microsoft, Murdock worked at Yahoo! Research in Barcelona, Spain where she led the Geographic Context and Experience Group, doing research on topics related to geographic information retrieval and user-generated content.  She has been awarded 15 patents, and has more than 30 patent applications pending, resulting in a Master Inventor Award from Yahoo! (2012). She received the OAA Award for Outstanding Achievement by a Young Alum from the University of Massachusetts in 2014.  She has more than 50 publications in the area of Information Retrieval.  Murdock received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2006.

									<h4>Speaker Bio</h4>
									<p>
									Hung Q. Ngo was a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo from 2001 to 2015. From 2015, he started working for a couple of startups building datalog and data analytic engines: LogicBlox and RelationalAI. His current research and development interests include the design, analysis, and implementation of in-database computation algorithms. These algorithms cover typical logic and statistical query optimization. He received a CAREER award, a COCOON 2008 best paper award, PODS 2012 and PODS 2016 best paper awards.​

									<h3>Pablo Barceló, University of Chile (CL)</h3>
									<h4>Keynote: A Theoretical View on Reverse Engineering Problems for Database Query Languages</h4>
									A typical reverse engineering problem for a query language L is, given a database D and a sets P and N of tuples over D labeled as positive and negative examples, respectively, is there a query q in L that “explains” P and N, i.e., the evaluation of q on D contains all positive examples in P and none of the negative examples in N? Applications of reverse engineering problems include query-by-example, classifier engineering, and the study of the expressive power of query languages. 

</br></br>
In this talk I will present a family of tests that solve the reverse engineering problem described above for several query languages of interest, e.g., FO, CQ, UCQs, RPQs, CRPQs, etc. We will see that in many cases such tests directly provide optimal bounds for the problem, as well as for the size of the smallest query that explains the given labeled examples. I will also present restrictions that alleviate the complexity of the problem when it is too high. Finally, I will develop the relationship between reverse engineering and a separability problem recently introduced to assist the task of feature engineering with data management tools.
