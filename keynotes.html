									<h3>Leave No Valuable Data Behind: the Crazy Ideas and the Business</h3>
									<p>Xin Luna Dong.</p>
									</header>
									<p>
									<span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br> 
									With the mission "leave no valuable data behind", we developed techniques for knowledge fusion to guarantee the correctness of the knowledge. This talk starts with describing a few crazy ideas we have tested. The first, known as "Knowledge Vault", used 15 extractors to automatically extract knowledge from 1B+ Webpages, obtaining 3B+ distinct (subject, predicate, object) knowledge triples and predicting well-calibrated probabilities for extracted triples. The second, known as "Knowledge-Based Trust", estimated the trustworthiness of 119M webpages and 5.6M websites based on the correctness of their factual information. We then present how we bring the ideas to business in filling the gap between the knowledge in existing knowledge bases and the knowledge in the world.

									<h3>Querying on Complex Databases by Content and Context – Challenges and Real Applications</h3>
									<p>Agma J. M. Traina</p>
									</header>
									<p>
									<span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br> 
									The amount and complexity of data generated and managed in nowadays systems, such as images, videos, and time series among others, bring several challenges to the data management developers in order to comply with the expectation of the users and data owners. Not only the majority of the applications demand searching complex data through queries considering several different aspects on the same data, but also getting the answers in a timely manner. Content-based similarity retrieval enables performing queries and analyses using the required features automatically extracted from the data without user intervention. <br>
									In this talk we will discuss the challenges posed to the database and related communities in order to provide techniques and tools to overcome the precision and time concerns regarding similarity queries over complex data. Examples and results obtained with two decades long experience over real applications will be presented and discussed.

									<h3>Shannon-type Inequalities for Optimal Query Processing</h3>
									<p>Dan Suciu, University of Washington.</p>
									</header>
									<p>
									We consider the problem of computing a conjunctive query over an input database with known statistics, with a goal of designing "optimal" algorithms.  The statistics include the cardinalities of the base relations, and upper bounds on the degrees of some attributes of some relations. For example a functional dependency is a special case of a degree constraint where the degree bound is 1.  We describe query evaluation algorithms using Shannon-type information-theoretic inequalities.  For a full conjunctive queries, the information-theoretic inequality gives an upper bound on the size of the output of the query; the AGM bound on the output of the query is the special case of statistics restricted to cardinalities.  For general conjunctive queries, the information-theoretic inequality give the (generalization of the) sub-modular width of the query.  We describe algorithms that match the bounds of these Shannon-type inequalities.

									<h3>Linked Data: Turning Practice into Theory</h3>
									<p>Aidan Hogan</p>
									</header>
									<p>
									Now over a decade old, Linked Data has seen plenty of practice but not a lot of theory. Linked Data inherits some of its theory from its big brother the Semantic Web, who inherited much of its theory, in turn, from Knowledge Representation. Some of that KR theory has had impact on Linked Data in practice; some has not. More recently, Linked Data has also inherited some theoretical results from its wealthy uncle, the Database. Some of that theory has had direct impact on Linked Data in practice; some has not. This perhaps raises a number of questions. First: does Linked Data need (more) theory, and if so, for what? Second: what can the theory from KR, databases, etc., actually predict about the practice of Linked Data (if anything)? Third: why must Linked Data be resigned, in theoretical terms, to inheriting theory? Or, rephrasing: can Linked Data have any interesting theoretical questions of its own that are not trivially answered by stitching up the sleeves of the theory from elsewhere? In this talk, I will first give an overview of Linked Data in terms of its inception, motivation, successes and failures thus far. I will then give my own (limited) perspective on the previous questions in terms of the relationship between the theory and practice of Linked Data (and perhaps as a tenuous generalisation, to other areas of CS). The goal of the talk is then to try to explore what opportunities might exist for better bridging theory and practice in 
									future, particularly in the context of Linked Data.

									Aidan Hogan is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science (DCC) at the Universidad de Chile and an Associate Researcher of the Chilean Centre for Semantic Web Research. His main interests lie in the area of the Semantic Web and Linked Data, where he has worked on a variety of topics relating to the management of large, decentralised, diverse, dynamic and often dirty corpora of structured data (as are native to the Web). He has won various awards at international research events, including a best evaluation paper (ISWC), best poster (ESWC), and several awards for reviewing (SWJ, EKAW, ISWCx3, WedDB); he has also picked up a couple of other best paper nominations (including at ISWC and WWW). He serves on the editorial boards of the Semantic Web Journal and the Journal of Web Semantics. He has given several invited lectures at summer schools and has presented a variety of tutorials at conferences (though this will be his first real keynote).
