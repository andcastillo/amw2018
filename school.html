					The AMW Summer School is a two day event preceding the Alberto Mendelzon Workshop on Foundations of Data Management 2018 to be held in Cali, Colombia. 
					The event consists of multiple tutorials aimed at a mixed audience of students and other interested attendees. </p>
					<h3>Our goals</h3>
					<p>
						<ul>
						<li>Host tutorials targeted at students (advanced undergraduate or postgraduate level) or other early term researchers interested in the area of Data Management;
						</li>
						<li>Provide a venue where young Latin American students and researchers can meet, discuss, learn, and seek feedback on their research topics, thus reinforcing research networks (of the future) in the area.
						</li>
						</ul>

									<h3>Denis Parra, PUC Chile (CL)</h3>
									
									<h4>Tutorial: A Tutorial on Information Visualization and Visual Analytics</h4>
									This tutorial introduces fundamental aspects in information visualization such as marks, channels, idioms, and principles from 
cognitive science which allow to design effective visualizations. In order to analyze existent visualizations and implement new ones
in a systematic way, we will introduce the framework by Munzner (2014) which addresses the problem with nested levels: Domain/situation (what), 
Data/task abstraction (why), visual encoding/interaction idiom (How), and algorithms. Several examples of existent visualizations are analyzed 
within this framework in order to understand its usage, and finally rules of thumb are synthesized for preventing common mistakes when
designing new visualizations. Finally, examples which combine data mining methods with visualizations are explained in detail in 
order to understand and eventually implement models for visual analytics.

									<h3>Martín Ugarte, Free University of Brussels (BE)</h3>
									
									<h4>Tutorial: Understanding the Bitcoin Protocol</h4>
									In the last five years, Bitcoin has gained a good deal of attention, reaching in December 2017 a market capitalization close to three hundred billion (US) dollars and a daily trading volume of hundreds of millions of dollars. Although Bitcoin is considered mostly as a financial asset, the protocol published in 2008 by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto goes far beyond: it achieves consensus in a decentralized and trust-less network. In this tutorial we will discuss in detail how this consensus is achieved, from the underlying cryptography to the specifics of the protocol and the so-called Blockchain data structure. We will also discuss the incentives of the different actors in the Bitcoin network, and how these incentives complement the underlying cryptography to enforce the security of the digital currency.

									<h4>Speaker Bio</h4>
									<p>
									Martín Ugarte is a postdoctoral researcher at the Free University of Brussels (ULB) in Belgium, where he has been working for the last two years under the Laboratory for Web & Information Technology. He obtained a PhD from the Catholic University of Chile on the topic of logics and query languages for the Semantic Web. His current research interests include query answering over dynamic datasets and information extraction, amongst other aspects of data management. He has recently published and participated on the main database conferences and journals. Martin is also an advocate of Cryptocurrencies, and has given tutorials on several universities and institutions on the foundational aspects of Cryptocurrencies and their applications to Smart Contracts.
